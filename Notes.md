5.	When we use shift key while drawing rectangle it will draw sqare always
6.	Using Spacebar you can move the artboard
7.	Using alt key and move a object it will copy it 
8.	Using ctrl+SPACE to use zoom tool

12.	The resize handle in the object end points are used to change the size of the object 
13.	If I use shift key then it will change size in the same proportion (Equal width and equal height ratio)
14.	Near to the resize hadle there is a rotation handle appears to rotate the object
15.	Using shift key will rotate the object in 45^ each rotation
16.	Using ctrl+D we can repeat the previous operation done by selection tool.
17.	When taking copy using alt key we can press shift key to take 90* copies
18.	Experiment You can Create multiple copies using ctrl+D after copying previous one we can create a list of object in sequence like in the Bee.ai file

24. Since that use ctrl + d to repeat the drag and you can do the same task with same distance.

##		Direct Selection Tool

11. When you select a particular side of rectangle with direct selection tool you can change the inner circle properties of single side or selected side of the shape.
12. Handles and anchor points are same we can use them to bend the shape of the object.

<img src="cuboidBox.png" width=100px><br>
1. Draw a Rectangle or Square make 3 copies of it, one on top and one on right intersecting to the 1st block.
2. Select the top handles of the top square and bend them towards bottom right.
3. Similarly select the right handles of the right square and bend them towards top left.
4. As such we have a cuboid now, select from left to rotate the cuboid like this.
5. Select Left handles of bottom and top square and bend towards top for rotating the cuboid.
6. Now make copy of the shape and risize it with slection tool.
7. Now Select from the bottom of the main and right square and resize the path to reduce its height.
8. Now you have prepared both the box and its cap now use selection tool to select objects and drag on top of the 1st cuboid.
